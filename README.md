# UglyChat
Web Chat implemented with scala, play framework, akka actors and websockets. Funny, isn't it?

This projecte is a demo project to test the possibilities of websockets with play framework. I'm also starting with
 scala and akk actors, so why not mix all this stuff and try to do a little project? The interface has been developed
 with foundation and a bit of jquery.

Take a look to the code (it's documentated) and feel free to use it or to ask me some questions.

You can see this applications running (or maybe not) at [scala.shotbingo.com](http://scala.shotbingo.com/) 

Bye!
